# UnityHttp
HttpClient from .Net Core ported to Unity3D

This is a port of HttpClient to Unity. Note that it requires Unity 2017 or newer with .Net 4.6 experimental scripting backend. 99% of the code is taken from https://github.com/dotnet/corefx.git. I just moved around some stuff and added some conditionals and generally converted it into a form that works in Unity. This is by no means complete, I just brought in only what I needed for a specific project. But it should include almost all of HttpClient.

Tested on:
- Unity 2017.2.1p3
- Uwp

Most of these are scripts and shouldn't break anything or create conflicts. However take a look at the contents of plugin folders to ensure you don't already have the same plugins. Also there's a editor script that upgrades the .Net Core runtime (via nuget) of the UWP builds generated by Unity.

Feel free to use it as you like. And if you find someway to improve this please consider contributing back :)
